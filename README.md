### :bar_chart: Projects :

- ## [Forecasting Energy Demand](https://github.com/Polinia/projects_Portfolio/tree/main/Project:%20Forecasting%20Energy%20Demand)
  The project considers the problem of planning demand for electricity using intellectual data analysis. The purpose of the study was to obtain a reliable forecast of electricity consumption. In the course of the study, a set of methods of scientific knowledge, including machine learning methods, was applied.
- ## [Graduation project: Fake/Real Job Posting Prediction](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/graduate_project)
  The project aims to create a model for the classification of jobs as real or fraudulent. In this project, I have tried to use Natural Language Processing and different Machine Learning algorithms
- ## [Car classification by their photos](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_7)
  The goal was to build an image classification model trying various methods of image preprocessing. I have learned how to use multiple learning methods together (fine-tuning, transfer learning) and pre-trained models for solving the problem
- ## [Car Price prediction Part2](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_8)
  The goal was to predict car price by its characteristics, text description, or picture using Neural networks and Computer Vision
- ## [Recommendation Challenge](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_6)
  The goal of this project was a development of a recommender system for a large online retail company. The recommendation system should be based on the most accurate recommendation of the right product in a high price category.
- ## [Credit Scoring](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_4)
  I built a scoring model for the bank's secondary clients that would predict the probability of a client's default. To do this, it was necessary to determine the significant parameters of the borrower.
- ## [Car classification & price prediction](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_5)
  I had to create a model for car price prediction based on its characteristics. I have tried different Machine Learning algorithms for the best results. Ialso managed to experiment with staking with various meta-algorithms.
- ## [Exploratory Data Analysis of students](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_2)
  The tracking of the impact of the living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their results in mathematics for identification of students that are at the risk at an early stage.
- ## [Restaurant Rating prediction](https://github.com/Polinia/skillfactory_rds/tree/main/module_3)
  I used Trip Advisor's data to build a model for expected ratings. The goal was to identify any deviations from this model or any inconsistencies because these needed to be evaluated more closely. Such analyses have the potential to identify errors or fraudulent reviews.
